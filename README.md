# 🏦 Bank System

A simple **Bank Management System** built in **C++ (console app)**.  
The project is divided into two parts:  
- **Classes Library** → Handles accounts, customers, and transactions.  
- **UI Project** → Provides a user interface to interact with the system.  

This project demonstrates **OOP concepts** and the separation of **business logic** from the **user interface**.
